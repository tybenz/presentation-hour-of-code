- Want to talk about code - how it effects your lives
- What sorts of things you use everyday that are run by code

- Websites
- Video games
- Microwaves
- Light-up shoes

Ex:

  app
  what you can make
- Computer parts
  - RAM
  - ROM
  - Hard-drive
  - GPU

Ex 2:
- Lego maze
- We are going to use simple instructions to tell our lego guy what to do

Ex 3:
- Now it's time to improvise.
- Volunteer - We're going to write a program that
  will help the car get from here to there.

Ex 4:
- Soldier video game
- ?skipclear
- Timer
- Space game

Rest of the time:
- We are going to write some code
- Some of you may not write code with a computer today, but you'll still be
  learning how computers work
