- Want to talk about code - how it effects your lives
- What sorts of things you use everyday that are run by code

Ex:
- Google -> show code
- Minecraft -> show code
- Slate -> show code

Ex 2:
- Lego maze
- We are going to use simple instructions to tell our lego guy what to do
- These instructions are like the code that people write for computers

Demo:
- Now it's time to improvise.
- Volunteer - We're going to write a program that
  will help the car get from here to there.
- We only have these three commands to work with and the delay is set
- Meaning when you tell the car to turnLeft, it will make an exact 90ยบ turn.

Rest of the time:
- We are going to write some code
- Some of you may not write code with a computer today, but you'll still be
  learning how computers work
