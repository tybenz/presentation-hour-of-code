- Want to talk about code - how it effects your lives
- What sorts of things you use everyday that are run by code

Ex:
- Facebook -> show code
- Minecraft -> show code
- Voice -> show code
  - Today I went to Hickman Charter School to help out with a very special
    event.
  - The Hour of Code
  - We talked a lot about software and how we use things that run on code every
    day
  - Then the kids got to try some excercises that introduced them to coding
  - And great fun was had by all

Ex 2:
- Car
- Explain how arduino works
- Explain how each pattern works

Demo:
- Now it's time to improvise.
- Volunteer - We're going to write a program that
  will help the car get from here to there.
- We only have these three commands to work with and the delay is set
- Meaning when you tell the car to turnLeft, it will make an exact 90ยบ turn.

Rest of the time:
- We are going to write some code
- Some of you may not write code with a computer today, but you'll still be
  learning how computers work
